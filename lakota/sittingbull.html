      <p>Sitting Bull kept out of serious trouble until 1890. The Messiah Craze Ghost Dance had come into Indian country on most of the Sioux reservation in South Dakota. In the fall of 1890 the new religion came to Standing Rock and it was believed Sitting Bull was a supporter of the Ghost Dance. On December 15, 1890, Sitting Bull and seven of his followers were killed as well as six Indian police. The killing of Sitting Bull was one of the events which led directly to the incident at Wounded Knee.
