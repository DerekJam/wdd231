      <h3>Red Cloud (Maȟpíya Lúta)</h3><br><p>An Oglala Lakota leader best known for his undaunted courage while leading his people in several important victories over the forces of the United States.</p><br>
<p>
        He was born in Nebraska in September 1822 near the Platte River. He had a twin brother, Roaring Cloud, also known as “Sky.” Sadly, almost nothing is known about this man.</p><br>
        <p>
        Red Cloud's intelligence, strength, and bravery were widely known throughout the tribe. He was credited with 80 coups or individual feats of bravery. Eventually, he was chosen as tribal leader over the hereditary claimant, Young Man Afraid of His Horses.
